## Project Name
Basic AI Chatbot
## About
A Flask-based AI chatbot leveraging TensorFlow's seq2seq model with bidirectional LSTM layers, designed for toddler-friendly conversations. It uses a synthetic dataset of simple questions and answers, incorporates a custom loss function and accuracy metrics, and provides a web interface for user interaction.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system.
Additional libraries are required:

-Flask

-TensorFlow

-NumPy

-Matplotlib

Install them via:

`pip install flask tensorflow numpy matplotlib`

## Features
This Basic AI Chatbot includes these features:

-Web-based chat interface powered by Flask for seamless user interaction.

-Sequence-to-sequence model with bidirectional LSTM layers for generating toddler-appropriate responses.

-Synthetic dataset tailored for child-friendly conversational AI.

-Custom loss function and accuracy metrics to optimize and evaluate conversational performance.

-Session-based chat history for persistent user-bot interactions.

-Visualized training metrics using Matplotlib for model performance analysis.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/basicAiChatbot.git`

Install the required dependencies:
`pip install flask tensorflow numpy matplotlib`

## Usage
Run the Python script (app.py) from the command line:
`python app.py`

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the chatbot via the web interface. Enter questions about AI, and the chatbot will respond with toddler-friendly answers. Use the "Clear History" button to reset the chat session.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master the implementation of seq2seq models with bidirectional LSTM for natural language processing.

-Integrate TensorFlow models with Flask for creating deployable AI-driven web applications.

-Design and utilize synthetic datasets for training domain-specific conversational models.

-Develop and apply custom loss and accuracy metrics for evaluating AI performance.



Enhance skills in debugging and logging for complex AI and web systems.
